# Miscellaneous things

A bunch of miscellaneous stuff. Generally not worthy of its own repository either due to crappy code, being too small or laziness.

## Stuff

### DrawSomethingCheats/

A quick hack for those occasions where I'm struggling with draw something. It works a tad better than my previous solution of:

    $ cat /usr/share/dict/words | egrep '^[setOfLetters]{numberOfLetters}$'

As it accounts for duplicated letters. It'd be cool if I knew how to do that with regex (or knew if it was even possible).

### bf/

A couple of brainfuck implementations I wrote while bored. Not the best code I've written, particularly the crappy D port.

### misc/

Actual miscellaneous stuff which I can't be bothered finding a home for elsewhere.

### dotfiles/

A selection of dotfiles which I use. I'll probably forget to update these and be stuck with my old copy/paste method. Oh well.

## License

See individual files for licensing. Stuff in here tends to be fairly liberal (WTFPL/BSD/Boost/MIT/whatever). If you see something without a license and want to use it somewhere where licensing matters let me know and we can sort something out. Same goes for licensed files too for that matter!
